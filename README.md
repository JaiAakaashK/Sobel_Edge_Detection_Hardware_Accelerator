# Sobel_Edge_Detection_Hardware_Accelerator
This is a Sobel Edge Detection hardware accelerator designed to import greyscale image to obtain Sobel edge detected image by using Sobel gradient algorithm. All sub-modules are included here alongside output and testbench as well. Additionally python codes are also give for greyscale image conversion and .pgm to .jpg conversion for output image
